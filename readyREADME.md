## Description
This is a Node.js command line application that takes in user's answers to predefined questions and applies that input to create a good README file. 

This application was a homework assignment. I had to make this application to avoid failing my development bootcamp. Nevertheless the application is useful as it helps to create well formatted README files. Throughout the process I learned how to use Node.js and work with npm packages, specifically - Inquirer.js.
